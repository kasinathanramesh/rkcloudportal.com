</head><body>Question 1: <br/>
Alex is an employee in an organization. While working with the Company’s sensitive legal contract, he encrypted the document and took a backup of that file, and deleted the encrypted file, but he forgot to delete the original copy of the file, and he went on vacation; later, he remembered that he forgot to delete the original file from his workplace machine. Alex has stored the document on the Desktop of his office computer. He approaches you to access the document and delete the file permanently from his workplace machine. Initialize a Windows remote desktop connection to access the file and enter the document number present in the file. Note: Computer name- Server2016; Username- Administrator; Password- shadow123<br/>

<br/>
Question 2:<br/>
<br/>
Chris, a network security specialist, was assigned to examine a packet capture file (moviescope.pcapng) located in the Documents folder of the Ethical Hacker-I machine and check if any user credentials were associated with www.moviescope.com are recorded in plain text format.<br/>
<br/>
Chris concluded that the site traffic was traversing in plain text, and he was able to access one of the usernames and passwords recorded in one of the packets. Enter the credentials found in the capture file. Give your response in the following format: Username/Password.<br/>
<br/>
sam/test123<br/>
<br/>
Explanation<br/>
Keywords to Notice: pcapng, hostname, Plain text format<br/>
Firstly, We will login to the Host Ethical hacker-1, then we will navigate to Documents Folder to access the moviescopemm.pcapng file by opening it in Wireshark Application.<br/>
Secondly, Since the credentials are in plain text we get the Plain text data by Right Clicking the IP Address of moviescope.com website and Selecting Follow -&gt; TCP Stream<br/>
Note: There will be huge data to analyze but a simple search trick will help, in search box enter <b>user </b>and keep clicking<b> Find Next </b>button until your find the username and password value.<br/>
<br/>
Question 3: <br/>
<br/>
An employee of an organization has stolen the company’s trade secrets and encrypted them using VeraCrypt.

<br/>
Question 11<br/>
A web application &quot;www.moviescope.com&quot; is vulnerable to SQL injection attacks. You are an ethical hacker working in a web development specify the method that poses a high risk to the web application. Hint: Use OWASP ZAP tool.<br/>
<br/>
POST<br/>
<br/>
Explanation<br/>
Keywords to Notice: Method, OWASP , SQL Injection<br/>
There are two paths to solve this problem.<br/>
1. Here we must remember the HTTP Methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE etc) which are used in communication on Internet. Also, mostly parameter is passed using GET and POST methods. So, without using the OWASP tool on can guess it would be <b>POST or GET</b> method.<br/>
2. Run the OWASP tool, enter the web app URL and click on Attack button, wait till the attack completes and click the Spider section and analyze the request method used in it.<br/>
<br/>
Question 12<br/>
<br/>
. A critical file has been hidden in the Server 2016 machine in the directory mentioned below. You are an ethical hacker working with a company. You have been assigned to retrieve the file &quot;SECRET.txt&quot; using a backdoor installed in the server.

<br/>
Explanation<br/>
Keywords to Notice: server 2016, SECRET.txt, backdoor, Path<br/>
Firstly, Since we already have the IP Address and Credential for Server 2016 we can easily login to the Sever and navigate to that folder.<br/>
Secondly, As the file SECRET.txt is hidden, Open up Powershell Terminal and type <b>ls -force</b> and <b>cat SECRET.txt</b><br/>
<br/>
Remember, there are multiple Path to reach a Destination, but the best path would be easy with less Time.<br/>
<br/>
Question 13<br/>
A folder named &quot;Imp&quot; has been sent to Joseph's machine over an email. Joseph suspects that someone might have tampered with the files during transmission. The Original hashes of the files have been retained by the sender and stored in a folder named Hash. Joseph has approached you to check the integrity of the file by comparing the MD5 hashes. Compare the hash values and determine the file name that has been tampered with.<br/>
<br/>
Path:: \Users\Admin\Documents\lmp\Hash Note: Exclude the file extension in the answer field. The answer is case-sensitive.<br/>
<br/>
File2<br/>
<br/>
Explanation<br/>
Keywords to Notice: MD5 hashes, Imp folder, Path<br/>
In this case we have to compare one file hash with another and determine if there is change in it, we can HashCalc or MD5 Calculator.<br/>
Firstly, Open the File which contains the hash value and now open <b>HashCalc </b>tool to open the file which we need to verify the integrity.<br/>
Compare the Hash value, if there is change, then the file is been tampered or if both are same then the files are not tampered.<br/>
<br/>
<b>There is no need to the answer to be right in this Exam Questions , but the understanding of Concept is explained, so stick to methods/Steps/basics.</b> <br/>
